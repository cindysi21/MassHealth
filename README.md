\f1\b0\fs32 \cf2 I believe data visualizations are incredibly powerful. They have the ability to empower communities, can provide vulnerable populations access to invaluable knowledge, and ultimately give communities the ability to hold people in power accountable. As we continue to produce more and more data, it's important we can still understand and parse it into actionable and useful information so we can continue to make the most informed decisions. It is also important to remember that we live in a biased world where discrimination is the foundation we've built everything else off of - so when we use data to provide insight on policies or to train machines on, it's important to remember where it all came from.\
The visualization for this data is located in the Graph tab. Each dot/rectangle represents an encounter between 2008 and 2016. The way the data is presented here ensures that encounters and patient experiences are not reduced to a single number or clumped into a bar where it makes it  easy for us to forget that data isn't just numbers - it is lived experiences too. Along with the graph is the rest of the assignment:\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 Data:
\f1\b0 \'a0Details the data that was provided (Q1)\

\f0\b Assumptions:
\f1\b0 \'a0Reveals important assumptions made in the regressions\

\f0\b Analysis:
\f1\b0 \'a0Regression analysis\

\f0\b Program Design:
\f1\b0 \'a0The 1-year program design\

\f0\b Code:
\f1\b0 \'a0a zip file that contains all the code used for the whole project.\
Within the code folder, there is a Stata log file (schmidtAPMData.smcl), Jupyter notebooks used to clean the data for Q1 and the graph (Q1.ipynb, Graph.ipynb), and the pdf version of the Q1 Notebook (Q1_Code.pdf).\
Within the data folder, there are the 11 provided datasets and graph.csv (used to create the graph) and EmergencyVisits.csv (used in the regression).\
The images folder is holds images used in the site.\
I hope this makes grading the challenge more enjoyable than reading a PDF and the visualization makes the data more accessible/approachable. Thank you for your time :)\
